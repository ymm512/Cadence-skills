# Analyze - Legacy Code Analysis

## Overview

Analyze existing codebase before requirement and design phases. Understand current architecture, dependencies, and technical debt.

**Core Value**:
- 🎯 Avoid reinventing the wheel
- 🔍 Identify technical debt and risks
- 📊 Understand module dependencies
- 🛡️ Assess change impact scope

**Important**: This is a **necessary step when modifying existing code**.

## When to Use

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Project has existing code (not brand new)
- ✅ Project contains code files (not documentation-only)
- ✅ CLAUDE.md has been read to understand tech stack

### Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:
- User says "analyze existing code..."
- User says "understand current architecture..."
- PRD involves modifying existing system
- Need to understand technical debt
- Involves multi-system integration

### Decision Flow

```dot
digraph analyze_decision {
    "Receive requirement" [shape=box];
    "Project has code?" [shape=diamond];
    "Skip Analyze" [shape=box];
    "Involves existing code?" [shape=diamond];
    "Trigger this skill" [shape=box];

    "PRD mentions modifying modules" [shape=box];
    "User says 'analyze code'" [shape=box];
    "Need to understand tech debt" [shape=box];
    "Multi-system integration" [shape=box];

    "Receive requirement" -> "Project has code?";
    "Project has code?" -> "Skip Analyze" [label="no"];
    "Project has code?" -> "Involves existing code?" [label="yes"];
    "Involves existing code?" -> "Skip Analyze" [label="no"];
    "Involves existing code?" -> "Trigger this skill" [label="yes"];

    "Trigger this skill" -> "PRD mentions modifying modules";
    "Trigger this skill" -> "User says 'analyze code'";
    "Trigger this skill" -> "Need to understand tech debt";
    "Trigger this skill" -> "Multi-system integration";

    "Skip Analyze" -> "Proceed to Requirement" [label="directly"];
}
```

### Skip Conditions

Skip this node when:
- Brand new project (no existing code)
- Independent module (doesn't touch existing code)
- Documentation-only project (no code files)
- User explicitly says it's not needed

## The Process

### Detailed Workflow

```dot
digraph analyze_process {
    "Read CLAUDE.md" [shape=box];
    "Get tech stack info" [shape=box];
    "Read PRD to define scope" [shape=box];
    "Scan project structure" [shape=box];
    "Identify core modules" [shape=box];
    "Analyze dependencies" [shape=box];
    "Check technical debt" [shape=box];
    "Generate analysis report" [shape=box];
    "User confirms?" [shape=diamond];
    "Supplement analysis" [shape=box];
    "Save artifact" [shape=box];
    "Proceed to Requirement" [shape=box];

    "Read CLAUDE.md" -> "Get tech stack info";
    "Get tech stack info" -> "Read PRD to define scope";
    "Read PRD to define scope" -> "Scan project structure";
    "Scan project structure" -> "Identify core modules";
    "Identify core modules" -> "Analyze dependencies";
    "Analyze dependencies" -> "Check technical debt";
    "Check technical debt" -> "Generate analysis report";
    "Generate analysis report" -> "User confirms?";
    "User confirms?" -> "Supplement analysis" [label="missing items"];
    "Supplement analysis" -> "Generate analysis report";
    "User confirms?" -> "Save artifact" [label="accurate"];
    "Save artifact" -> "Proceed to Requirement";
}
```

## After the Analysis

### Automatic Trigger Logic

After successfully completing the analysis (user confirms accuracy), automatically trigger the following 4 steps:

#### Step 1: Save Analysis Artifact

**Action**: Save the legacy analysis report to designated location

**Location**: `.claude/analysis-docs/{YYYY-MM-DD}_LegacyAnalysis_{ModuleName}_v1.0.md`

**Example**:
```
.claude/analysis-docs/2026-03-05_LegacyAnalysis_UserAuth_v1.0.md
```

**Content**: Complete analysis report including tech stack, architecture, dependencies, risks, and user confirmation.

#### Step 2: Update Progress Tracking

**Action**: Update progress tracking file to mark Analyze node as completed

**File**: `.claude/plans/progress.json` or equivalent tracking file

**Update Content**:
```json
{
  "current_node": "analyze",
  "status": "completed",
  "completed_at": "2026-03-05T10:30:00Z",
  "artifacts": [
    ".claude/analysis-docs/2026-03-05_LegacyAnalysis_UserAuth_v1.0.md"
  ]
}
```

#### Step 3: Provide Next Step Recommendation

**Action**: Automatically recommend the next skill node based on flow type

**Recommendation Logic**:
- **Full Flow**: Recommend `requirement` skill
- **Quick Flow**: Recommend `requirement` skill
- **Exploration Flow**: Recommend `design` skill

**Output Format**:
```
✅ Analysis completed successfully!

📋 Next recommended step: Requirement Analysis
💡 Trigger command: /cadence:requirement

Would you like to proceed to Requirement Analysis? (Y/n)
```

#### Step 4: Prepare Handoff Context

**Action**: Prepare context summary for the next skill node

**Handoff Content**:
```markdown
## Handoff from Analyze to Requirement

### Analysis Summary
- **Tech Stack**: [from CLAUDE.md]
- **Key Modules**: [modules identified]
- **Dependencies**: [critical dependencies]
- **Risks**: [high/medium risks identified]
- **Technical Debt**: [debt items]

### Key Artifacts
- Legacy Analysis Report: `.claude/analysis-docs/{date}_LegacyAnalysis_{ModuleName}_v1.0.md`

### Recommended Focus Areas for Requirement
- [Focus area 1 based on analysis findings]
- [Focus area 2 based on analysis findings]
- [Focus area 3 based on analysis findings]
```

**Purpose**: Ensure smooth transition and provide context for the next skill node.

### User Interaction

**After automatic trigger logic completes, ask user**:
```
Analysis artifact saved. Progress updated.

Would you like to:
1. ✅ Proceed to Requirement Analysis (recommended)
2. 📋 Review the analysis report first
3. 🔄 Make adjustments to the analysis
4. ⏸️ Pause and continue later

Please choose [1-4]:
```

## Red Flags ⚠️

### Must Avoid

| Wrong Approach | Right Approach |
|---------------|----------------|
| ❌ Skip Analyze and go directly to Design | ✅ Must understand existing code before designing |
| ❌ Only analyze surface code, ignore deep dependencies | ✅ Need to deeply understand data flow and call chains |
| ❌ Force design without fully understanding legacy code | ✅ Ask user for clarification when in doubt |
| ❌ Ignore tech stack info in CLAUDE.md | ✅ Must read CLAUDE.md first to understand project context |
| ❌ Don't analyze technical debt and risks | ✅ Must identify and record technical debt |
| ❌ Generate report without confirmation | ✅ Must confirm analysis accuracy with user |

## Integration

### Dependencies

**Optional Dependencies**:
- `brainstorming` - PRD document (for full flow)

**Prerequisites**:
- Project contains code files
- CLAUDE.md exists and contains tech stack info

### Next Steps

**Recommended Next**:
- `requirement` - Conduct requirement analysis based on legacy analysis

**Alternative Paths**:
- If analysis shows implementation is not feasible, return to `brainstorming` to adjust requirements
- If brand new project, skip this node and go directly to `requirement`

## Example

### Example Scenario: Modifying User Authentication Module

**Trigger**:
- PRD mentions "improve user login flow"
- Involves existing code modification

**Analysis Steps**:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md**:
   ```
   Tech Stack: Python + Django + JWT
   Architecture: MVC + Service Layer
   ```

2. **Scan Project Structure**:
   ```
   Found modules:
   - auth/          # Authentication module
   - users/         # User module
   - services/      # Business logic
   ```

3. **Identify Core Modules**:
   ```
   - auth/views.py::LoginView          # Login view
   - services/auth_service.py::AuthService  # Auth service
   - users/models.py::User             # User model
   ```

4. **Analyze Dependencies**:
   ```
   LoginView → AuthService → User Model
                ↓
            JWT Handler
   ```

5. **Check Technical Debt**:
   ```
   - Weak password strength validation
   - JWT expiry time hardcoded
   - Missing login failure rate limiting
   ```

6. **Generate Report**:
   ```
   Save to: .claude/analysis-docs/2026-03-01_LegacyAnalysis_UserAuth_v1.0.md
   ```

7. **User Confirmation**:
   ```
   Show key findings, ask: "Is the analysis accurate?"
   ```

## Best Practices

### DO - Recommended

✅ **Read CLAUDE.md first**: Must understand tech stack before analyzing
✅ **Deep dependency analysis**: Don't just look at surface calls, understand data flow
✅ **Identify risks**: Proactively identify technical debt and potential risks
✅ **Confirm timely**: Ask user for confirmation when in doubt
✅ **Complete documentation**: Analysis report should include all key information

### DON'T - Avoid

❌ **Skip CLAUDE.md**: Start analyzing without understanding tech stack
❌ **Superficial analysis**: Only analyze surface, don't go deep into dependencies
❌ **Ignore risks**: Don't identify or hide technical debt
❌ **Assume**: Don't guess without confirmation when uncertain
❌ **Incomplete records**: Omit key information

## Summary

**Core Value of Analyze Skill**:
1. 🎯 **Avoid reinventing** - Identify reusable existing code
2. 🔍 **Reduce risk** - Identify technical debt and risks early
3. 📊 **Provide basis** - Provide foundation for subsequent requirement analysis and design
4. 🛡️ **Ensure quality** - Ensure changes won't break existing functionality

**Remember**: When modifying existing code, Analyze is an essential step!
